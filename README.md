# 🎤 Voice Recognition System

This repository contains a voice recognition system developed as part of a university project for a Digital Signal Processing (DSP) course. The project demonstrates the application of DSP techniques to implement a basic voice-controlled assistant using Python.

## 📚 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a simple voice recognition system capable of executing basic tasks based on user voice commands. It uses Python libraries for voice processing and integrates with tools like Wikipedia and web browsers for real-time responses.

## 🛠️ Features

- Voice command recognition using `speech_recognition`
- Text-to-speech interaction with `pyttsx3`
- Wikipedia search and response
- Ability to open websites and respond to commands like telling the time

## 📦 Dependencies

Make sure you have the following Python packages installed:

- `pyttsx3`
- `speechrecognition`
- `wikipedia`
- `pyaudio` *(Note: May require OS-specific setup)*

Install them with:

```bash
pip install pyttsx3 SpeechRecognition wikipedia pyaudio
